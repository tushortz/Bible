Revelation 2:25 - But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

Revelation 2:26 - And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

Revelation 2:27 - And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
