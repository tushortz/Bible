Job 21:1 --> But Job answered and said, 

Job 21:2 --> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 

Job 21:3 --> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 

Job 21:4 --> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 

Job 21:5 --> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 

Job 21:6 --> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 

Job 21:7 --> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 

Job 21:8 --> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 

Job 21:9 --> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 

Job 21:10 --> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 

Job 21:11 --> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 

Job 21:12 --> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 

Job 21:13 --> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 

Job 21:14 --> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 

Job 21:15 --> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 

Job 21:16 --> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

Job 21:17 --> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. 

Job 21:18 --> They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 

Job 21:19 --> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. 

Job 21:20 --> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

Job 21:21 --> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 

Job 21:22 --> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 

Job 21:23 --> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 

Job 21:24 --> His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 

Job 21:25 --> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 

Job 21:26 --> They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 

Job 21:27 --> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. 

Job 21:28 --> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 

Job 21:29 --> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 

Job 21:30 --> That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 

Job 21:31 --> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? 

Job 21:32 --> Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 

Job 21:33 --> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. 

Job 21:34 --> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
