Job 19:1 --> Then Job answered and said, 

Job 19:2 --> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 

Job 19:3 --> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. 

Job 19:4 --> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. 

Job 19:5 --> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: 

Job 19:6 --> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 

Job 19:7 --> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. 

Job 19:8 --> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 

Job 19:9 --> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 

Job 19:10 --> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. 

Job 19:11 --> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. 

Job 19:12 --> His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 

Job 19:13 --> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. 

Job 19:14 --> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 

Job 19:15 --> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 

Job 19:16 --> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. 

Job 19:17 --> My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. 

Job 19:18 --> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. 

Job 19:19 --> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 

Job 19:20 --> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 

Job 19:21 --> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 

Job 19:22 --> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 

Job 19:23 --> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 

Job 19:24 --> That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 

Job 19:25 --> For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 

Job 19:26 --> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 

Job 19:27 --> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. 

Job 19:28 --> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 

Job 19:29 --> Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
