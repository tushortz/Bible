Job 6:1 --> But Job answered and said, 

Job 6:2 --> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 

Job 6:3 --> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 

Job 6:4 --> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 

Job 6:5 --> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

Job 6:6 --> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

Job 6:7 --> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. 

Job 6:8 --> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

Job 6:9 --> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 

Job 6:10 --> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 

Job 6:11 --> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 

Job 6:12 --> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 

Job 6:13 --> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 

Job 6:14 --> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 

Job 6:15 --> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; 

Job 6:16 --> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: 

Job 6:17 --> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 

Job 6:18 --> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 

Job 6:19 --> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 

Job 6:20 --> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 

Job 6:21 --> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. 

Job 6:22 --> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 

Job 6:23 --> Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 

Job 6:24 --> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

Job 6:25 --> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 

Job 6:26 --> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? 

Job 6:27 --> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. 

Job 6:28 --> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. 

Job 6:29 --> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. 

Job 6:30 --> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
