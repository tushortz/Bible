Job 22:2 --> Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 

Job 22:3 --> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 

Job 22:4 --> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 

Job 22:5 --> Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 

Job 22:6 --> For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

Job 22:7 --> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 

Job 22:8 --> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 

Job 22:9 --> Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

Job 22:10 --> Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 

Job 22:11 --> Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 

Job 22:12 --> Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 

Job 22:13 --> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 

Job 22:14 --> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 

Job 22:15 --> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 

Job 22:16 --> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 

Job 22:17 --> Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 

Job 22:18 --> Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

Job 22:19 --> The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 

Job 22:20 --> Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 

Job 22:21 --> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. 

Job 22:22 --> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 

Job 22:23 --> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 

Job 22:24 --> Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 

Job 22:25 --> Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 

Job 22:26 --> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 

Job 22:27 --> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 

Job 22:28 --> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 

Job 22:29 --> When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 

Job 22:30 --> He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
