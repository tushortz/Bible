Job 29:1 --> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 

Job 29:2 --> Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 

Job 29:3 --> When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 

Job 29:4 --> As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 

Job 29:5 --> When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; 

Job 29:6 --> When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 

Job 29:7 --> When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! 

Job 29:8 --> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. 

Job 29:9 --> The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 

Job 29:10 --> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 

Job 29:11 --> When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: 

Job 29:12 --> Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. 

Job 29:13 --> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 

Job 29:14 --> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 

Job 29:15 --> I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. 

Job 29:16 --> I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 

Job 29:17 --> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. 

Job 29:18 --> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. 

Job 29:19 --> My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 

Job 29:20 --> My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 

Job 29:21 --> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 

Job 29:22 --> After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 

Job 29:23 --> And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 

Job 29:24 --> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. 

Job 29:25 --> I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
