Job 33:1 --> Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. 

Job 33:2 --> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 

Job 33:3 --> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 

Job 33:4 --> The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 

Job 33:5 --> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up. 

Job 33:6 --> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 

Job 33:7 --> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 

Job 33:8 --> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 

Job 33:9 --> I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. 

Job 33:10 --> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 

Job 33:11 --> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 

Job 33:12 --> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 

Job 33:13 --> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 

Job 33:14 --> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. 

Job 33:15 --> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 

Job 33:16 --> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 

Job 33:17 --> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 

Job 33:18 --> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 

Job 33:19 --> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: 

Job 33:20 --> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 

Job 33:21 --> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. 

Job 33:22 --> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. 

Job 33:23 --> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 

Job 33:24 --> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 

Job 33:25 --> His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: 

Job 33:26 --> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. 

Job 33:27 --> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 

Job 33:28 --> He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 

Job 33:29 --> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 

Job 33:30 --> To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 

Job 33:31 --> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

Job 33:32 --> If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 

Job 33:33 --> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
