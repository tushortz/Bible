Genesis 34:14 --> And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 

Genesis 34:15 --> But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;

Genesis 34:31 --> And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
